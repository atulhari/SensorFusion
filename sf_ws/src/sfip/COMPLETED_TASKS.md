# Completed Tasks for SplineFusion Refactoring

## Refactoring Achievements

1. **Refactored SplineState into a header-only library**
   - Created a comprehensive SplineState.hpp with full template support
   - Implemented a thin wrapper SplineState.cpp file
   - Added proper documentation for all methods
   - Improved quaternion handling with consistent operations
   - Enhanced safety with proper bounds checking

2. **Modularized Core Components**
   - Separated the functionality into clean components:
     - SplineState: B-spline representation and operations
     - WindowManager: Sliding window management
     - Optimizer: Non-linear optimization
     - DataProcessor: Measurement processing and IMU integration
   - Created well-defined interfaces between components

3. **Documentation and Structure**
   - Added comprehensive documentation to all classes and methods
   - Updated PR_SUMMARY.md with completed tasks and new TODOs
   - Ensured the CMakeLists.txt is properly configured for the new structure

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Complete Implementations**
   - Finish implementing any required template methods in SplineState
   - Add validation for parameters in constructor methods
   - Add explicit error handling for edge cases
   - Fix include dependency issues in SplineFusionCore.cpp - currently has incomplete type errors

2. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for each component
   - Test with real data to verify correctness
   - Benchmark performance against the original implementation

3. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - Update the main README.md to reflect the new architecture
   - Remove any remaining unnecessary files
   - Document best practices for extending the library

## Build Instructions

For building in a standard ROS environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the package directory
cd sf_ws/src/sfip

# Copy the new CMakeLists.txt (already done)
# cp CMakeLists_new.txt CMakeLists.txt

# Build using catkin
cd ../../..
catkin_make
```

For ROS2, a future migration would require:
1. Updating the adapter layer for ROS2 interfaces
2. Modifying CMakeLists.txt for ament_cmake
3. Updating launch files to ROS2 format
