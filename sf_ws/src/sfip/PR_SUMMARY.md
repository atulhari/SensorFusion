# Pull Request: SplineFusion Refactoring

## Overview

This PR refactors the SplineFusion codebase to separate the core algorithm from ROS-specific code. The goal is to improve maintainability, make the code more testable, and simplify future migration to ROS2.

## Key Changes

1. **Created a modular, ROS-independent core library**
   - Separated the algorithm into distinct components (SplineState, WindowManager, Optimizer, DataProcessor)
   - Created well-defined interfaces between components
   - Moved core functionality into a ROS-independent library

2. **Added a ROS adapter layer**
   - Created a SplineFusionAdapter class to handle ROS-specific functionality
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing ROS message types

3. **Improved code organization and clarity**
   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Used consistent naming conventions
   - Eliminated global variables

4. **Enhanced stability and robustness**
   - Added data validation and error handling
   - Improved quaternion handling with consistent Lie group operations
   - Fixed issues with window management and timestamp handling

## Implementation Details

### New Classes and Files

- `Types.hpp`: Common data structures and types
- `SplineFusionCore.hpp/cpp`: Main class orchestrating the fusion process
- `WindowManager.hpp/cpp`: Manages the sliding window of control points
- `Optimizer.hpp/cpp`: Handles the optimization process
- `DataProcessor.hpp/cpp`: Processes and integrates IMU data
- `SplineFusionAdapter.hpp/cpp`: ROS adapter for the core library
- `SplineState.hpp`: Header-only implementation of the B-spline state management

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ Refactored SplineState into a header-only library for better template support
- ✅ Created core component interfaces with clean separation of responsibilities
- ✅ Implemented SplineFusionCore with modular design
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation to all components
- ✅ Created new CMake configuration to build the library and executables

### Backwards Compatibility

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility with the existing ROS interface:
- Same topic names and message types
- Same parameter names and behavior
- Same launch files

## Testing

To test the refactored code:

1. Build the package using the new CMakeLists.txt:
   ```
   cp CMakeLists_new.txt CMakeLists.txt
   catkin_make
   ```

2. Run the original nodes (for comparison):
   ```
   roslaunch sfip sfip.launch
   ```

3. Run the new nodes:
   ```
   roslaunch sfip sfip_new.launch
   ```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement SplineState.cpp as a thin wrapper for the header-only library
2. Complete implementation of all required template methods in SplineState
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for each component
4. Further optimize performance, especially in the optimization process
5. Remove remaining temporary functions that use ROS types
6. Add explicit error handling for edge cases in the DataProcessor
7. Add validation for parameter values in SplineFusionCore constructor
8. Update the main README.md to reflect the new architecture

## File Structure Changes

- New files in include/sfip/ directory for core library headers
- New files in src/sfip/ directory for core library implementations
- New adapter classes to bridge between core library and ROS
- New launch files for the refactored nodes

## Review Requests

1. Feedback on the overall architecture
2. Review of the quaternion handling in SplineState
3. Performance evaluation of the optimization process
4. Suggestions for further improvements
