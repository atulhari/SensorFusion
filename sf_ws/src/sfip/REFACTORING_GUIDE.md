# SplineFusion Refactoring Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the refactoring work performed on the SplineFusion codebase, including the rationale, approach, and next steps.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Isolate the core algorithm from ROS-specific code
2. **Improved Maintainability** - Create a modular structure with well-defined interfaces
3. **Enhanced Testability** - Make components independently testable
4. **Simplified Evolution** - Prepare for future migration to ROS2

## Architecture Changes

### Before

The original code had several issues:
- Tightly coupled ROS dependencies throughout the codebase
- Monolithic classes with mixed responsibilities
- Implicit communication between components
- Difficult to test individual components

### After

The new architecture consists of:

1. **Core Library**
   - `SplineState` - B-spline representation and operations
   - `WindowManager` - Manages the sliding window of control points
   - `Optimizer` - Handles the non-linear optimization problem
   - `DataProcessor` - Processes measurements and performs IMU integration
   - `SplineFusionCore` - Orchestrates the core components

2. **ROS Adapter Layer**
   - `SplineFusionAdapter` - Bridges between ROS and the core library
   - `EstimationInterface_new` - Handles ROS topic subscriptions and publications

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Created clean interfaces for all core components
- ‚úÖ Implemented SplineState as a header-only library
- ‚úÖ Refactored the window management logic
- ‚úÖ Separated optimization from data processing
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Created ROS-independent data types

### In Progress
- üîÑ Fixing include dependencies and resolving incomplete type errors
- üîÑ Implementing unit tests for individual components
- üîÑ Fine-tuning performance optimizations

### To Do
- ‚ùå Complete ROS2 adapter implementation
- ‚ùå Add comprehensive benchmarking tools
- ‚ùå Create CI/CD pipeline for testing

## How to Build and Test

### Building the New Code

```bash
# Navigate to the package directory
cd sf_ws/src/sfip

# Copy the new CMakeLists.txt (if not already done)
cp CMakeLists_new.txt CMakeLists.txt

# Build using catkin
cd ../../..
catkin_make
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the unit tests
catkin_make run_tests_sfip

# Run ROS tests
rostest sfip test_spline_fusion.test
```

### Launching the New Nodes

```bash
# Launch the refactored nodes
roslaunch sfip sfip_new.launch
```

## Debugging Tips

1. **Incomplete Type Errors**
   - Check include order in implementation files
   - Ensure forward declarations are properly defined before use
   - Use pimpl idiom for further decoupling if needed

2. **Runtime Performance**
   - Profile optimization steps with timing instrumentation
   - Monitor memory usage during window sliding operations
   - Check for redundant calculations in the critical path

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Compare output trajectories between old and new implementations
   - Validate that transformation chains are consistent
   - Ensure timestamp handling is precise across all components

## Next Steps for Future Development

1. **Complete ROS2 Migration**
   - Create ROS2 adapter implementations
   - Update launch files for ROS2
   - Migrate message definitions to ROS2

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement parallel optimization for multi-core processors
   - Optimize memory layout for better cache locality
   - Consider GPU acceleration for large-scale problems

3. **Extended Features**
   - Add support for additional sensor types
   - Implement online calibration
   - Add predictive capabilities for high-latency environments
